# Risks Hiding in the Tools We Love

Examples from the 2022 AMIA Informatics Summit panel "S21: Identifying and Addressing the Evolving Privacy and Security Risks Lurking in Translational Science"

This repository shows examples illustrated in our presentation on how information can be leaked by tools we or our colleagues may use on a regular basis.

This repository also illustrates the example (not discussed in detail during the presentation) of how files 'deleted' in git aren't actually deleted.  See if you can find the files containing (fake) PII in the repository history.
